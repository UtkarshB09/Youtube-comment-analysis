# Youtube-comment-analysis

It is a web application made specially for youtube to know the reviews separately as positive and negative comments.
It asks for youtube video url and mail id.
The web application scrapes the comments of the video and analyses the positive and negative comments.
The time for scraping the comments depends on how many comments in the video. After the process is complete, the comments are mailed to the id given by the user as an excel file.
Three files will be sent to the given id namely:
Full comments
Positive comments
Negative comments
It will also produce a HTML table when the process is finished in the background.
There are two tables: Positive Comments Table and Negative Comments Table.
